Using the CLI, create a plain text file (.txt) that contains the commands necessary to answer the following questions:

1-How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

first you create a folder/file the normal way
to create a folder >>>>    mkdir foldername
to create a file  >>>>  touch file-name

then you can hide or unhide(display) it 
to hide it >>>>  attrib +h the folder/file route
to unhide(display) it >>>> attrib -h the folder/file route

2-How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

mkdir -p /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun

3-How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:

echo 'first message' > filename
echo 'second message' >> filename
